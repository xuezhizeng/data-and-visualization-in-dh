title: Course Description
...

In this methods course you will receive an introduction to data manipulation and visualization for historians. You will learn to work with historical data, including finding, gathering, manipulating, analyzing, visualizing and arguing from data, with special attention to geospatial, textual, and network data. These methods will be taught primarily through scripting in the R programming language, and other command line tools as appropriate. While historical methods can be applied to many topics and time periods, they cannot be understood separate from how the discipline forms meaningful questions and interpretations or divorced from the particularities of the sources and histories of any topic. Therefore, this course we will examine the historiographical tradition to see how historians have used data and visualization to understand the past. And we will work together to apply these methods to a linked series of data sets in the history of nineteenth-century American religion.

## Learning goals

After taking this course, you will be able to

-   perform exploratory data analysis; clean, tidy, and manipulate data; gather historical data from print and manuscript sources; use existing historical data sets provided by government or other research groups; create common visualizations; work with geospatial, textual, and network data.
-   write scripts in the R programming language and its extensive set of packages and to use command line tools.
-   understand the place of data analysis and visualization within humanities computing, digital history, and the discipline of history.
-   conceive of and execute a historical research project suitable for treatment in a dissertation chapter or journal article.
-   take the course "Programming in History/New Media," a.k.a. [Clio 3](http://lincolnmullen.com/courses/clio3.2014/).

I may also post additional material to my [book in progress](http://lincolnmullen.com/projects/dh-r/) on the subject of the course.

## Software

We will use this software during the course. Plan on bringing a computer to each class meeting.

-   An [RStudio Server instance](http://rstudio.chnm.org/) (kindly provided by RRCHNM) will give you access to R in your browser. You will be given a user name and password. You should, however, consider installing [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/) and [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop) on your own computer.
-   That same server will give you access to a Linux (CentOS, to be precise) command line which you can access through SSH. You will receive instruction on how to do this in class. Mac and Linux computers come with SSH installed; on Windows you will need to install [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/).
-   Much of your work for the course will go on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Sign up for an account.
-   [Slack](https://slack.com/) will replace e-mail and Blackboard for our course. You will receive an invitation to the [Mason Data and DH](https://dataanddh.slack.com/) team. You may wish to install [one of the apps](https://slack.com/downloads). Here is an [introduction to Slack](https://vimeo.com/133692325) from one of Kris Shaffer's courses.
