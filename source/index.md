...

This course introduces students to data manipulation and visualization for historians. Students will learn to work with historical data using methods from the subfield formerly known as humanities computing. These methods include data gathering, manipulation, analysis, and visualization with special attention to geospatial, textual, and network data. These methods will be taught primarily through scripting in the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/), and other command line tools as appropriate. While historical methods can be applied to many topics and time periods, they cannot be considered separately from the general practices of the discipline nor from the particularities of sources and interpretations in any topic. Therefore, this course will frame these methods by examining the historiographical tradition to see how the historical profession has used data and visualization to understand the past. And it will apply the methods to a linked series of datasets in the history of nineteenth-century American religion.

## Learning goals

Use professional (not consumer) level tools. Write analysis code. Do exploratory analysis Manipulate, clean, and tidy data Conceive of and execute on a project that would contribute to a dissertation or article

This course is also intended to prepare students for the course "Programming in History/New Media," aka Clio 3.

After taking this course, students will be equipped to use historical data analysis in their dissertations or research papers.
