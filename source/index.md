This course introduces students to data manipulation and visualization for historians. The first unit of the course will examine the historiographical tradition to see how the historical profession has used data and visualization to understand the past. The second unit will teach students how to use off-the-shelf tools for data analysis, including visualization and mapping, of publicly available datasets such as censuses. Students will learn quantitative reasoning and elementary statistics of use to historians. The third unit will introduce the basics of scripting (in R or Python) for data analysis and visualization, and students will create their own datasets relevant to their research. After taking this course, students will be equipped to use historical data analysis in their dissertations or research papers.

## Learning goals
