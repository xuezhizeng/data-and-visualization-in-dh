### General policies

See the [George Mason University catalog](http://catalog.gmu.edu/) for general policies, as well as the university [statement on diversity](http://ctfe.gmu.edu/professional-development/mason-diversity-statement/). You are expected to know and follow George Mason's policies on [academic integrity](http://oai.gmu.edu/) and the [honor code](http://oai.gmu.edu/understanding-the-honor-code/). Ask me if you have any questions about how these policies apply to this course. Note the dates for dropping and adding this course from the [academic calendar](http://registrar.gmu.edu/calendars/spring-2016/).

### Accommodations

If you are a student with a disability and you need academic accommodations, please see me and contact the Office of Disability Services at 703-993-2474 or <http://ods.gmu.edu>. All academic accommodations must be arranged through that office.

### Assignments

Do all the readings, work through all exercises, complete any assignments, and install any necessary software before the start of each class.

I may change due dates or assignments. I will always give you plenty of notice of changes, which will always be intended for your benefit. Students must satisfactorily complete all assignments (including participation assignments) in order to pass this course.

### Attendance

Your attendance is expected at every meeting. If you must be absent, I request that you notify me in advance of the class meeting.

### Communication

I am always glad to make an appointment to meet with you in person. I may send official course communications to your George Mason e-mail address, which you should check regularly. I will discuss grades only in person.

The online syllabus is the only authoritative version. Check it regularly.

### Privacy

You may be required to make some of your work publicly available. If you wish, you may do so under a pseudonym to keep your identity private from the public, though I and the other students in the course will have access to your work.

### Late work

I am sometimes willing to grant extensions for cause, but you must request an extension before the assignment's due date. For every day or part of a day that an assignment is late without an extension, I may reduce your grade. No work (other than final exams and final projects) will be accepted later than the last day that the class meets unless I have agreed otherwise.
